// Small pictures of windows for the taskbar's thumbnails, copied by the compositor through
// ext-image-copy-capture-v1 from the capture source shaodesk-window-control-v1 gives for a
// window: from version 3 one the compositor scales down to the picture's size itself, smoothly,
// and from version 2 one at the window's size. It runs on its owner's Wayland connection, whose
// events the owner dispatches.
//
// While a window is watched it is captured into a shared-memory buffer: once, or again each time
// it redraws, at most every `interval` milliseconds. Each frame is scaled down if it needs to be,
// on a pool of threads, and kept, small, until the window closes; the session and its buffer
// last only while the window is watched. Windows are named by the owner's numbers for them.
