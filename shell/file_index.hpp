// folders (or the configured ones).
//
// The folders are read on a thread of their own, breadth first, down to `depth` levels and
// `limit` names at most, leaving out hidden files and folders, what is on another file system,
// and what is inside a version-controlled tree (one holding .git, .hg, .svn, .bzr or _darcs), a
// build tree (CMakeCache.txt, or the CACHEDIR.TAG a cache directory has) or node_modules and
// __pycache__, though such a folder is found by its own name. Symbolic links are listed but not
// followed. They are read the first time a search asks for files, so that nothing is read
// before anyone searches, and again when a search asks once the names are older than five
// minutes or something changed in a folder searched from (one of the roots) or in the recent
// files; the search meanwhile finds what was read before, and `changed` says when the new names
