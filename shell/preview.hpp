// minimized, one asking for attention), sound outputs and applications playing, a battery and
// Wi-Fi, a backlight, tray items (one with a menu), a few notifications, every power action,
// night light on, a music player playing with a browser paused behind it, power-profiles-daemon
// in its balanced mode, and NetworkManager connected to a Wi-Fi network among others. The controller's own models take the tray, the notifications and the power
