// The history of what is copied, as Windows' Win + V and KDE's Klipper keep it: text, and
// pictures, newest first, the pinned ones ahead and kept however long the history grows.
//
// It is a client of the compositor's ext-data-control-v1 on a Wayland connection of its own
// (connectDisplay), which hears every change of the clipboard whoever makes it, and reads what was
// copied without taking the keyboard: the text (its best type), HTML and a list of files when
// they are offered too, and a picture (PNG, JPEG and the like). What a password manager marks as
// secret (x-kde-passwordManagerHint = secret) is not kept, nor anything copied while the session
// is locked. restore() makes an entry what is copied again, offering every type it was copied
// with (the text under its usual names), and the newest entry; without data-control it goes
// through Qt's clipboard instead, which then needs the keyboard. Kept in memory only unless
// `persist`, then in a file only the user can read.

// `output`, which the clipboard_history action toggles.
