-- shaodesk configuration, API version 1.

-- Copy this file to ~/.config/shaodesk/init.lua and edit it. Every setting is optional; a
-- line that is commented out shows the default. The full list of settings, types, defaults
-- and ranges is in docs/config-reference.md.
--
-- Check a file without starting the compositor:
--     shaodesk --config init.lua --check-config
-- A misspelled setting, a value of the wrong type, or one out of range is reported with
-- its file and line (and a "did you mean" hint). Saving the file reloads it (auto_reload);
-- while it has an error, the default configuration stands in and the error shows across
-- the top of the screen. Super+Shift+R, or SIGHUP, also reloads it.
--
-- The file is plain Lua that returns a table. It can use variables, string, table and math
-- functions, but cannot read files or run programs. Launch commands are argument arrays,
-- never shell strings: { "kitty", "--title", "term" }.
--
-- To keep your own file short, start from the shipped one and change only what you like:
--     return { extends = "default", mouse = { modifier = "Alt" } }
-- Its bindings yield to yours on the same keys, and action = "none" removes one.
-- Hyprland-style Super shortcuts. A nested session inside a host that grabs Super
-- (Hyprland, GNOME) never sees them; set mod = "Alt" there.
