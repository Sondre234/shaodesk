"""The window switcher's pictures of windows in a session: as the switcher opens, each of its
cards asks for its window's picture, which the shell copies from the compositor through the
window control's capture source, scaled down by the compositor, and shows it. Two windows share a
title, which the switcher's lines would not tell apart; their numbers do, so each card pictures
its own window. Closing the switcher lets the sources go. The windows are on a workspace not
shown, so their colours on the screen can only be the pictures'. Without grim the pixels are left
out."""
