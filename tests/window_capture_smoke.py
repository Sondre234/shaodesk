"""Capturing one window, as the taskbar's pictures do through shaodesk-window-control-v1's
get_capture_source and get_scaled_capture_source and screen sharing through
ext-foreign-toplevel-list: a session on the window's capture source copies the window's own
surfaces at its size, without the border or shadow shaodesk draws around it, also while it is
minimized or on a workspace not shown; it follows the window as it redraws and stops as it
closes. A scaled source's frames fit the size asked for, keep the window's aspect ratio and are
never larger than the window, follow it as it changes size, come only as it draws, and come at
once to a second session on the same source. While the session is locked, or once the window is
gone, a source is inert, its session stopped at once, and the client asking stays connected."""
