and `above` while the window's title and app ID match it, as they change, and gives back what the
window had once they no longer do; a change by hand meanwhile stays. One matching as the window
opens holds it from the start, a static rule acts as the window opens only, opacity rules follow
the title either way, and reloading the rules lets go of what they no longer hold."""
