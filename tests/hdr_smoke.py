"""HDR on headless outputs, which have no EDID: without hdr anywhere nothing changes and
color-management-v1 is not offered; a monitor asking for HDR whose EDID does not offer BT.2020
with PQ stays SDR and says why, and so does one that offers them (SHAODESK_TEST_HDR stands in for
its EDID) with a renderer that cannot convert colours, as pixman and GLES cannot. With
SHAODESK_TEST_VULKAN=1 and a GPU, the Vulkan renderer offers color-management-v1, and the test of
HDR, which the headless backend refuses (it takes no colour space), leaves the monitor SDR and
drawn as before: not run by default, as it needs a GPU. Driving a monitor in HDR needs a real
one."""
