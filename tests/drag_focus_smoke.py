"""Drag and drop with a real button press, driven by a virtual pointer (pointer_probe): one
window probe drags a line of text from its window, another takes it. A window activated while the
drag lasts, through the taskbar protocol as the shell brings one forward under a drag resting on
its button, comes forward at once: restored if minimized, its workspace shown. Once the drag ends
it has the keyboard, which the drag held, and the pointer is on what lies under it at once rather
than once it next moves. Dropped where nothing takes it, the drag is cancelled."""
