"""Windows' own icons, as shaodesk-window-control-v1 sends them from version 5: a Wayland window's
from xdg-toplevel-icon-v1 (a name, pixels, or both) and an X11 window's from _NET_WM_ICON, of
their sizes the largest within 256 by 256 or else the smallest larger one, premultiplied ARGB in a
sealed file. A window's objects hear its icon with its first state when it has one, and again as
it changes or is dropped, but not when it is set to the same again; a client of version 4 hears
none of it. `get window_icons` lists them. Without XWayland the X11 part is skipped."""
