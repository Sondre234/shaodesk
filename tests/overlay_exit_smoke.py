what is under them. Slowed down to a tenth: the command palette stays on screen for a moment after
Escape closes it, but no longer holds the keyboard, which the window under it has back at once,
and it is gone once it has faded; opened again while it fades, it comes back with the keyboard.
The window switcher fades out the same way after it is cancelled."""
