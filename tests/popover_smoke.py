maps it on the overlay layer with the keyboard, a press on the bar while a popup is open switches
popups in one press, and a press beside the popups closes them without reaching the window under
it, which gets the keyboard back. The windows of a stacked button, listed on hover, leave the
keyboard where it is. The bar's own surface keeps its size throughout. With grim, the popups are
