"""Dragging over the taskbar in a session, as on Windows: a drag from a window (a real button
press, driven by pointer_probe, on a window probe that drags a line of text) resting half a second
on another window's button brings that window forward, a minimized one restored and one on another
workspace with its workspace; resting on a stack's button opens the card of its windows' pictures
in the popover, which the drag reaches as it maps, and resting on a picture brings that window
forward. A drag only crossing the buttons does nothing, and the card closes once the drag has left
it and its button. Dropped on the bar, the drag is cancelled, the shell having taken nothing: the
drag's source hears no target but none. Carried on to the window brought forward, it is dropped
there, and that window has the keyboard once the drag ends."""
