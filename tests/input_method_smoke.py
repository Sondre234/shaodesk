"""Input methods, as fcitx5 and ibus are: the compositor relays between an application's text
input (text-input-unstable-v3, `text_input_probe`) and the input method (input-method-unstable-v2,
`input_method_probe`). The text input of the window with the keyboard activates the input method
and tells it its surrounding text, content type and text cursor; the input method's preedit,
committed text and deletions go back to it. Its keyboard grab gets the keys no binding takes, and
what it passes on through its virtual keyboard reaches the window. Its popup sits under the text
cursor, kept on the output, above it where there is no room below, drawn over the window and under
the overlays. Focus moving between windows, either client going away and the session locking leave
both sides consistent, and a second input method is told it is unavailable. `get input_method`
shows it all."""
