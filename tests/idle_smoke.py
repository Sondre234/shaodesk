"""Power saving without an idle daemon (`idle`): after so long without input the screens dim (with
grim, the screen shows it), the monitors turn off and the screen locks, each once; input undoes the
dimming and turns on the monitors it turned off, the key that does it doing nothing else. An idle
inhibitor holds every step off, the steps on battery apply while a fake /sys/class/power_supply
says the machine runs on it, and an ext-idle-notify-v1 client (as swayidle is) hears of idleness
as before."""
