"""Peeking at one window through shaodesk-window-control-v1's set_peek, as the taskbar does while
the pointer rests on a window's picture: the other windows fade as for the desktop peek while
that one shows over them in full, a minimized window and one on a workspace not shown too, where
they are; nothing about any window changes. The peek moves from window to window without the
others coming back in between, and ends with a fade on unset_peek, or as the window closes or is
focused, the session locks, the client lets go of the object or disconnects, or the desktop peek
starts; then everything is as it was, stacked as it was. With grim the screen shows it."""
