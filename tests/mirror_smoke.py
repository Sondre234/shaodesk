"""Mirroring on headless outputs: a monitor with outputs.monitors' mirror leaves the layout (no
workspaces, windows or panels of its own) and shows its source's picture scaled to fit, with black
bars where the shapes differ, rotated with either of them, the cursor included; it follows its
source's power, joins the layout while its source is gone and leaves it again as it comes back,
holds a lock up as the others do, goes on mirroring when a wlr-output-management client applies
it where it is listed (on its source) and joins the layout moved elsewhere, and a reload without
mirror brings it into the layout. The
pictures are read with `headless_output capture`, and the source's with grim when it is
installed."""
