"""Tearing on a headless output, as get tearing reports it: with windows.allow_tearing a fullscreen
window asking through tearing-control-v1, or one a rule's allow_tearing names, has its output's
frames flipped at once, but not one that does neither, nor while a panel is drawn over it or the
overview is open, nor with the setting off; where the backend refuses an asynchronous flip
(SHAODESK_TEST_REFUSE_TEARING, as a GPU without them would) the frames go out at the refresh as
before. A real flip cannot be seen headless: the decisions and the commits' flags are what is
tested."""
