"""Touchscreens, from a headless one: a finger goes to the window under it through wl_touch, with
several at once, motion past the window's edge in its own coordinates, frames and cancel, and
focuses it; a panel takes fingers too. A window that never bound wl_touch gets the pointer and
its left button instead, from one finger at a time, as do the window controls (a tap on the
close light closes the window), the drag strip (a finger drags the window) and the desktop. The
screen is mapped to touch.output, else to the output the device names, else to a built-in
panel, else across every output; clients see a touch capability only while there is a
touchscreen."""
