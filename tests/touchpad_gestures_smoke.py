"""Touchpad swipes the compositor takes (`gestures`), from a headless pointer: three fingers
sideways move between workspaces, the windows held part of the way through their slide as the
fingers go and the step finishing past half way or with a flick, going back otherwise and at the
first and last workspace; three fingers up and down open and close the overview with them. Other
swipes reach the window under the pointer, one that waited for its direction from its beginning,
and none the compositor takes does. A swipe bound to a request runs it as the fingers lift; with
`invert` the directions swap; with gestures off every swipe is the window's."""
