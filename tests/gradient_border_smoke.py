"""Gradient borders: with windows.border_color or border_inactive_color a gradient, every border
is drawn in pieces of gradients (`get frames` says "gradient"), following focus, and in rects of
one colour again once neither is; a rounded window's corners round its border too. The pointer
reaches a window through its border's corners inside its geometry, as through a rounded rect's
hole. With grim the screen shows the colours: the focused window's border red at its left, blue
at its right and between the two in the middle, the other's green, a rounded corner clear outside
its arc and coloured on it."""
