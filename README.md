# shaodesk

A mouse-first Wayland desktop.<br>
Floating windows, edge snapping and optional Hyprland-style tiling, a Qt Quick shell with a
taskbar, launcher and notifications, and a Lua configuration that reloads when you save it.

> **Status:** early development. It runs as a standalone session from a TTY, where it is the
> author's everyday desktop on Gentoo, and nested in another Wayland session. A system tray and
> power controls are still missing, and it has been used on few machines.

## Highlights

- **Floating first.** Focus follows the mouse, Super + drag moves and resizes, windows snap
  and stick to edges, and new windows are placed where they cover the least.
- **Tiling when you want it**, per monitor: dwindle (as in Hyprland), master, spiral, monocle,
  and a niri/PaperWM-style scrolling layout.
- **Per-monitor workspaces**, a scratchpad, sticky windows, tab groups, window rules,
  terminal swallowing, and saved sessions you can restore.
- **A Qt Quick shell** on every monitor: taskbar, application menu, workspace indicator,
  battery, network, volume, clock and calendar, a notification daemon with history and
  do-not-disturb, an on-screen display, an Alt + Tab switcher, an Exposé-style overview,
  and a command palette.
- **Effects:** interruptible animations with spring curves, dimming of inactive windows, peek,
  night light, a magnifier, and hot corners.
- **Lua configuration** that is validated with file and line, reloads on save, can extend
  the defaults instead of copying them, and switches between appearance profiles.
  `shaodesk import` carries over an existing Hyprland/Waybar setup.
- **Scriptable:** every action, plus queries and an event stream, over a control socket
  (`shaodesk msg`).
- **Works with everyday applications:** XWayland, screen sharing through portals,
  `ext-session-lock` lockers, idle daemons, clipboard managers, and the protocols browsers,
  Electron applications and games look for.

See [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) for how each of these works.

## Building

Requirements:

- CMake 3.25+, C11 and C++20 compilers, pkg-config, Ninja (used below)
- Lua 5.4, xkbcommon
- wlroots **0.20.x** (its API changes between release series), wayland-server,
  wayland-protocols, wayland-scanner
- For the shell: Qt 6.5+ (Core, Gui, Network, Qml, Quick, Quick Controls Basic, Quick Layouts,
  the Wayland platform plugin, and DBus for notifications), LayerShellQt 6.6+, GLib/GIO,
  wayland-client
- libinput and xcb (with xcb-xfixes) when wlroots is built with its libinput backend or with
  XWayland; optionally sd-bus (libsystemd, libelogind or basu) for the
  [sleep inhibitor](docs/features.md#screen-locking-and-idle) and libpulse for the volume control
- Python 3 for the tests

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DSHAODESK_BUILD_COMPOSITOR=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Without `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` the build is `RelWithDebInfo`; pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` for a
debug build. Installing honours the usual prefix and `DESTDIR`. Gentoo setup is described in
[docs/gentoo.md](docs/gentoo.md).

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHAODESK_BUILD_COMPOSITOR` | `ON` | Build the wlroots compositor; `OFF` builds only the configuration, placement and tiling code and tests |
| `SHAODESK_BUILD_SHELL` | `ON` | Build the Qt Quick shell |
| `SHAODESK_SHELL_PREVIEW_ONLY` | `OFF` | Build only a shell UI preview, without LayerShellQt (see [Development](#development)) |
| `SHAODESK_NOTIFICATIONS` | `ON` | Build the shell's notification daemon (needs Qt DBus) |
| `SHAODESK_PULSEAUDIO` | `ON` | Build the panel's volume control (needs libpulse, which PipeWire also serves) |
| `SHAODESK_INSTALL_SESSION` | `OFF` | Install the display-manager session entry |
| `SHAODESK_XWM_WAKER` | `ON` | Work around lost X11 windows; turn off with wlroots patched by `packaging/patches/wlroots-xwm-drain.patch` |

## Running

```sh
./build/shaodesk --config config/init.lua --check-config   # validate a configuration
./build/shaodesk --config config/init.lua --exec kitty     # run nested, starting kitty
```

By default shaodesk opens as a window inside the current Wayland session. Other modes:

- `--session` runs it standalone on DRM/libinput from a TTY. It is in daily use on an NVIDIA
  desktop with three monitors at mixed scales and has run on an AMD laptop; hotplug is tested
  only with virtual outputs, and suspend is unchecked. See [docs/gentoo.md](docs/gentoo.md) and
  [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).
- `--headless` runs without any display, for tests.

The shell starts with the compositor unless you pass `--no-shell` or set
`shell.enabled = false` (headless mode never starts it). Everything after `--exec` is one
command, run without a shell, that inherits the compositor's Wayland socket.

When nested, the host may keep shortcuts for itself: a host that grabs Super (Hyprland, GNOME)
needs `mod = "Alt"` in the configuration. Applications that reuse an existing process or D-Bus
service may also open in the host session instead.

## Configuration

shaodesk reads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shaodesk/init.lua` (`~/.config/shaodesk/init.lua`), else the
installed example, [config/init.lua](config/init.lua); it never writes a personal
configuration for you. A configuration only needs what it changes when it extends the
defaults:

```lua
return {
    version = 1,
    extends = "default",
    theme = "theme.lua",
    bindings = {
        { mods = { "Super" }, key = "e", action = "spawn", command = { "dolphin" } },
        { mods = { "Super" }, key = "v", action = "none" }, -- drop a default binding
    },
}
```

Its bindings take their keys first and the defaults fill in the rest; `action = "none"` leaves
a key unbound. Other lists, such as `startup` or `shell.launchers`, replace the default list
whole.

Settings are checked before they apply, and a mistake is reported with its file and line.
Saving the file reloads it (`auto_reload = false` turns that off); a file with an error loads
the default configuration instead and shows the error across the top of every monitor until
it is fixed. `shaodesk --check-config` checks a file without starting anything. SIGHUP or
Super + Shift + R also reload; a reload does not rerun startup commands.

Lua can compute settings with the base, table, string, math and UTF-8 libraries; process and
file I/O are not exposed. The configuration is your own code: the evaluator is not a sandbox
for untrusted scripts.

  generated from the schema

- [docs/dotfile-import.md](docs/dotfile-import.md): `shaodesk import ~/.config` for Hyprland/Waybar setups

## Default bindings

Edit them in [config/init.lua](config/init.lua).

## Scripting

`shaodesk msg` runs any binding action, and queries state, over the compositor's control socket
(`SHAODESK_SOCKET`, set for everything the session starts):

```sh
shaodesk msg workspace 2
shaodesk msg output HDMI-A-1 toggle_tiling
shaodesk msg spawn foot
shaodesk msg get windows
```

A client that sends `subscribe` receives a line for every change of workspaces, tiling, the
switcher, the overview and urgent windows. See
[Control socket](docs/features.md#control-socket) for the queries and events.

## Development

The test suite needs no display: it covers configuration validation, the layouts, and a
headless compositor with real xdg-shell and X11 clients, the shell rendered offscreen, and the
notification daemon on a private D-Bus. `tools/check-all.sh` runs it again under ASan and
UBSan. [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md) records what has been tested, on which
hardware, and what has not.

To work on the shell UI without LayerShellQt, build the preview:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-preview -G Ninja -DSHAODESK_SHELL_PREVIEW_ONLY=ON
cmake --build build-preview
./build-preview/shaodesk-shell --config config/init.lua --preview
./build-preview/shaodesk-shell --config config/init.lua --preview --preview-desktop
```

Preview windows show the UI and can launch applications, but do not manage windows or reserve
space on the host desktop.

Work happens on short-lived branches off `main` that are merged back with `--no-ff`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes, and
[docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) for measurements.

Not yet done: a system tray, power controls, drag-to-edge snap previews, blur and shadows, and
Lua extension APIs for custom layouts and shell widgets.
