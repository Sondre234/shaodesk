# shaodesk

A mouse-first Wayland desktop.<br>
Floating windows, edge snapping and optional Hyprland-style tiling, a Qt Quick shell laid out
as macOS's (menu bar, dock, Launchpad) or as a taskbar, and a Lua configuration that reloads when
you save it.

> **Status:** beta; the latest release is 0.1.1. It is my everyday desktop on Gentoo,

## Highlights

- **Floating first.** Focus follows the mouse, Super + drag moves and resizes, windows snap
  and stick to edges, and new windows are placed where they cover the least.
- **Tiling when you want it**, per monitor: dwindle (as in Hyprland), master, spiral, monocle,
  and a niri/PaperWM-style scrolling layout.
- **Per-monitor workspaces**, a scratchpad, sticky windows, tab groups, window rules,
  terminal swallowing, and saved sessions you can restore, the last one at the next login.
- **A Qt Quick shell** on every monitor, in [the macOS style](docs/features.md#the-macos-style)
  (a menu bar and a dock, Launchpad, Spotlight, Control Center, Notification Center, in light and
  dark) or as a taskbar with a start menu and [pictures of a button's
  windows](docs/features.md#window-pictures) on hover and in the Alt + Tab switcher; either way:
  workspace indicator,
  Quick Settings (network, volume, brightness, battery, night light, tiling, appearance; each
  can sit on the bar instead), keyboard layout, a clock with the notifications and a calendar,
  a system tray, a notification daemon with history and do-not-disturb, an on-screen display,
  an Alt + Tab switcher, an Exposé-style overview, a command palette, and a power menu.
- **Power controls** through logind (systemd-logind or elogind): lock, suspend, hibernate,
  restart, power off and log out, locking before any sleep and closing windows first so that
  applications can save; and [power saving when idle](docs/features.md#power-saving-when-idle)
  without an idle daemon: the screens dim, the monitors turn off, the screen locks and the
  machine suspends after their timeouts, shorter on battery if you like, held off while a video
  plays. A laptop docked with its [lid closed](docs/features.md#the-laptop-lid) turns its own
  panel off.
- **Administrator passwords:** the shell is the session's polkit agent, so `pkexec`, GParted and
  updaters ask for a password in a dialog of their own.
- **Effects:** interruptible animations with spring curves, dimming of inactive windows, peek,
  night light, a magnifier, and hot corners.
- **Touch:** three-finger swipes move between workspaces with the fingers and open the
  overview, other touchpad gestures reach applications (pinch-zoom), touchscreens take several
  fingers at once, and drawing tablets give applications pressure and tilt.
- **Lua configuration** that is validated with file and line, reloads on save, can extend
  the defaults instead of copying them, and switches between appearance profiles.
  `shaodesk import` carries over an existing Hyprland/Waybar setup.
- **Scriptable:** every action, plus queries and an event stream, over a control socket
  (`shaodesk msg`).
- **Works with everyday applications:** XWayland, screen sharing through portals,
  `ext-session-lock` lockers, idle daemons, clipboard managers, and the protocols browsers,
  Electron applications and games look for.

See [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) for how each of these works.

## Building

Requirements:

- CMake 3.25+, C11 and C++20 compilers, pkg-config, Ninja (used below)
- Lua 5.4, xkbcommon
- wlroots **0.20.x** (its API changes between release series), wayland-server,
  wayland-protocols, wayland-scanner
- For the shell: Qt 6.9+ (Core, Gui, Network, Qml, Quick, Quick Controls Basic, Quick Layouts,
  Quick Effects, the Wayland platform plugin, and DBus for notifications, the tray, the media
  controls and the power mode),
  LayerShellQt 6.6+, GLib/GIO, wayland-client
- libinput and xcb (with xcb-xfixes and xcb-ewmh) when wlroots is built with its libinput
  backend or with XWayland; optionally sd-bus (libsystemd, libelogind or basu) for the
  [sleep inhibitor](docs/features.md#screen-locking-and-idle) and libpulse for the volume control
- Python 3 for the tests

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DSHAODESK_BUILD_COMPOSITOR=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Without `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` the build is `RelWithDebInfo`; pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` for a
debug build.

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHAODESK_BUILD_COMPOSITOR` | `ON` | Build the wlroots compositor; `OFF` builds only the configuration, placement and tiling code and tests |
| `SHAODESK_BUILD_SHELL` | `ON` | Build the Qt Quick shell |
| `SHAODESK_SHELL_PREVIEW_ONLY` | `OFF` | Build only a shell UI preview, without LayerShellQt (see [Development](#development)) |
| `SHAODESK_NOTIFICATIONS` | `ON` | Build the shell's notification daemon (needs Qt DBus) |
| `SHAODESK_PULSEAUDIO` | `ON` | Build the panel's volume control (needs libpulse, which PipeWire also serves) |
| `SHAODESK_TRAY` | `ON` | Build the panel's system tray (needs Qt DBus) |
| `SHAODESK_POLKIT` | `ON` | Build the shell's polkit authentication agent (needs libpolkit-agent-1; left out without it) |
| `SHAODESK_MEDIA` | `ON` | Build the media controls: Quick Settings' card and the media keys, through MPRIS (needs Qt DBus) |
| `SHAODESK_POWER_PROFILES` | `ON` | Build Quick Settings' power mode tile, through power-profiles-daemon (needs Qt DBus) |
| `SHAODESK_INSTALL_SESSION` | `OFF` | Install the display-manager session entry |
| `SHAODESK_XWM_WAKER` | `ON` | Work around lost X11 windows; turn off with wlroots patched by `packaging/patches/wlroots-xwm-drain.patch` |

## Installing

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSHAODESK_INSTALL_SESSION=ON
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

This installs `shaodesk`, `shaodesk-session` (see [First run](#first-run)) and `shaodesk-shell`,
the default configuration (`share/shaodesk/init.lua`), `shaodesk-portals.conf` for
xdg-desktop-portal, the documentation, and with `SHAODESK_INSTALL_SESSION` the session entry
display managers list. Choose the prefix
when configuring, as above: shaodesk looks for its default configuration under it, so
`cmake --install --prefix` with another one leaves that unfound. `DESTDIR` stages an install
for packaging. On Gentoo, `packaging/gentoo` has ebuilds; see [docs/gentoo.md](docs/gentoo.md).

shaodesk runs without any of these, and uses them when they are installed:

- a terminal: Super + Q opens the first of kitty, foot, alacritty, wezterm, ghostty, konsole,
  gnome-terminal and xterm that is installed ([how to choose one](#first-run))
- `grim` and `slurp` for screenshots, and `wl-clipboard` to copy them
- `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`, `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` and PipeWire for screen sharing and file
  choosers ([Portals](docs/features.md#portals))
- `Xwayland` for X11 applications
- a locker such as swaylock or gtklock for [locking](docs/features.md#screen-locking-and-idle),
  by hand or [when idle](docs/features.md#power-saving-when-idle)
- an icon theme (Adwaita, Breeze, Papirus, ...) for application icons, and `dconf` for the
  window buttons of GTK applications

The shell is the notification daemon; `notifications = { enabled = false }` leaves that to mako,
dunst or another one.

## Running

```sh
./build/shaodesk --config config/init.lua --check-config   # validate a configuration
./build/shaodesk --config config/init.lua --exec kitty     # run nested, starting kitty
```

By default shaodesk opens as a window inside the current Wayland session. Other modes:

- `--session` runs it standalone on DRM/libinput from a TTY. It is in daily use on an NVIDIA
  desktop with three monitors at mixed scales and has run on an AMD laptop; hotplug is tested
  only with virtual outputs, and suspend is unchecked. See [docs/gentoo.md](docs/gentoo.md) and
  [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).
- `--headless` runs without any display, for tests.

The shell starts with the compositor unless you pass `--no-shell` or set
`shell.enabled = false` (headless mode never starts it). Everything after `--exec` is one
command, run without a shell, that inherits the compositor's Wayland socket.

When nested, the host may keep shortcuts for itself: a host that grabs Super (Hyprland, GNOME)
needs `mod = "Alt"` in the configuration. Applications that reuse an existing process or D-Bus
service may also open in the host session instead.

### First run

- **From a display manager**, pick shaodesk from its list of sessions. The entry (installed with
  `SHAODESK_INSTALL_SESSION`, and by the Gentoo ebuild) runs `shaodesk-session`.
- **From a text console**, log in and run `shaodesk-session`. A seat manager (elogind,
  systemd-logind or seatd) has to give you the GPU and input devices, as it does for any
  Wayland desktop.
- **To try it first**, run `shaodesk` inside your current Wayland session; it opens in a window.

`shaodesk-session` runs `shaodesk --session`, passing its arguments on. Where nothing has
started a D-Bus session bus, as is usual without systemd, it starts one with `dbus-run-session`:
notifications, the tray and portals need one.

A standalone session starts the `startup` commands of the configuration and then the
applications set to start at login, the XDG autostart entries in `~/.config/autostart` and
`/etc/xdg/autostart` (see [Starting the session](docs/features.md#starting-the-session)).

Without `~/.config/shaodesk/init.lua`, the installed [config/init.lua](config/init.lua) is
used. It starts in the macOS style; the profiles in the system menu (the spiral at the top left)
switch to dark or to the taskbar. Super + R opens Launchpad (the start menu in the taskbar),
Super + Q opens a terminal, Super + C closes the
focused window, and Super + M quits; [Default bindings](#default-bindings) lists the rest. The
terminal is `$TERMINAL` when that is set, else the first one installed (kitty, foot, alacritty,
...). To choose it, write a configuration that extends the default:

```lua
return {
    version = 1,
    extends = "default",
    terminal = { "foot" },
}
```

When a binding cannot start its program, because none of those terminals is installed for
example, the panel says why for a few seconds.

shaodesk, the shell and the programs they start log to standard error, which `shaodesk-session`
writes to `~/.local/state/shaodesk/session.log` (in `$XDG_STATE_HOME` when that is set); the
previous session's log is kept as `session.log.old`. Running `shaodesk` yourself, keep it in a
file with `shaodesk --session 2> ~/shaodesk.log`.

## Configuration

shaodesk reads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shaodesk/init.lua` (`~/.config/shaodesk/init.lua`), else the
installed example, [config/init.lua](config/init.lua); it never writes a personal
configuration for you. A configuration only needs what it changes when it extends the
defaults:

```lua
return {
    version = 1,
    extends = "default",
    theme = "theme.lua",
    bindings = {
        { mods = { "Super" }, key = "e", action = "spawn", command = { "dolphin" } },
        { mods = { "Super" }, key = "v", action = "none" }, -- drop a default binding
    },
}
```

Its bindings take their keys first and the defaults fill in the rest; `action = "none"` leaves
a key unbound. Other lists, such as `startup` or `shell.launchers`, replace the default list
whole.

Settings are checked before they apply, and a mistake is reported with its file and line.
Saving the file reloads it (`auto_reload = false` turns that off); a file with an error loads
the default configuration instead and shows the error across the top of every monitor until
it is fixed. `shaodesk --check-config` checks a file without starting anything. SIGHUP or
Super + Shift + R also reload; a reload does not rerun startup commands.

Lua can compute settings with the base, table, string, math and UTF-8 libraries; process and
file I/O are not exposed. The configuration is your own code: the evaluator is not a sandbox
for untrusted scripts.

## Scripting

`shaodesk msg` runs any binding action, and queries state, over the compositor's control socket
(`SHAODESK_SOCKET`, set for everything the session starts):

```sh
shaodesk msg workspace 2
shaodesk msg output HDMI-A-1 toggle_tiling
shaodesk msg spawn foot
shaodesk msg get windows
```

A client that sends `subscribe` receives a line for every change of workspaces, tiling, the
switcher, the overview, urgent windows, the keyboard layout, the binding mode and the power
actions that may run. See [Control socket](docs/features.md#control-socket) for the queries and events.

## Development

The test suite needs no display: it covers configuration validation, the layouts, and a
headless compositor with real xdg-shell and X11 clients, the shell rendered offscreen, and the
notification daemon and the system tray on a private D-Bus. `tools/check-all.sh` runs it again
under ASan and UBSan. [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md) records what has been tested, on which
hardware, and what has not.

To work on the shell UI without LayerShellQt, build the preview:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-preview -G Ninja -DSHAODESK_SHELL_PREVIEW_ONLY=ON
cmake --build build-preview
./build-preview/shaodesk-shell --config config/init.lua --preview
./build-preview/shaodesk-shell --config config/init.lua --preview --preview-desktop
```

Preview windows show the UI and can launch applications, but do not manage windows or reserve
space on the host desktop. `--preview-popup NAME` opens one of the taskbar's popups on stand-in
windows, sound and notifications, and `tools/shell_gallery.py build OUT_DIR` saves a picture of
every popup in a light and a dark theme (see
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#seeing-a-change)).

Work happens on short-lived branches off `main` that are merged back with `--no-ff`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes, and
[docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) for measurements.

Not yet done: blur and shadows, and Lua extension APIs for custom
layouts and shell widgets.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue at [github.com/Sondre234/shaodesk/issues](https://github.com/Sondre234/shaodesk/issues).
The bug report template asks for `shaodesk --version`, the GPU and its driver, the wlroots version,
whether shaodesk ran nested or with `--session`, your configuration, and the log
([First run](#first-run) says where it goes).
