/* Short window animations on the plain wlroots scene graph: a window fades in and grows
 * slightly when it opens, a snapshot of its last frame fades out and shrinks when it closes,
 * and tiles glide to their new place when the layout changes.
 *
 * Each animation owns one scene tree and changes only what is below it: the tree's own
 * position (the glide), and the position, destination size, and opacity (or color, for
 * rectangles) of every buffer and rectangle inside it. The scene has no transform for a whole
 * subtree, so scaling moves and resizes each buffer about a common center. Clients and the
 * rest of the compositor keep writing to those nodes while an animation runs; a value that
 * differs from what the animation last set is taken as the node's new resting value. */
