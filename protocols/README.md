# Wayland protocol definitions

Vendored from the wlroots **wlr-protocols** project on 2026-09-23:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols/-/tree/master/unstable

The XML files include their upstream copyright and permissive license notices.
Keep those notices in source and installed copies. CMake generates client/server
bindings with wayland-scanner; generated code is not checked into Git.

The compositor advertises layer-shell version 4 and foreign-toplevel-management
version 3. Clients must bind no higher than the advertised version.

`wlr-output-power-management-unstable-v1.xml`, which wlopm and idle daemons use to turn monitors
off and on, was vendored from the same upstream on 2026-10-08.

The virtual pointer and virtual keyboard protocols are used only by the test client
`tests/pointer_probe.c`. `virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1.xml` is the copy in the
wayland-protocols-misc crate (from the same upstream), vendored on 2026-09-28.

`shaodesk-window-control-v1.xml` is shaodesk's own: the shell's window menu moves a window it
knows by its foreign-toplevel handle to another workspace or output, makes it sticky or floats
it, and hears where it is (see [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md#naming-a-window-from-the-shell)).
